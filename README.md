# HathSeSeekho - Sign Language ML

Welcome to **HathSeSeekho**, a machine learning-based project designed to enable automatic recognition and translation of **Sign Language** gestures. The goal of this project is to bridge the communication gap between people who use sign language and those who don’t, using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

This repository contains all the necessary code, models, and data used in the development of this project, along with instructions on how to run the code and train your own models.

## Project Overview

**HathSeSeekho** is a deep learning-based system that recognizes hand gestures to interpret **Indian Sign Language (ISL)**. The project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification to predict hand gestures. 

### Goals:
- Develop an accessible tool to help people with hearing disabilities communicate.
- Provide a real-time translation system from Sign Language to text or speech.
- Enable better integration of machine learning with assistive technologies.

## Features
- **Gesture Recognition**: Detects hand gestures and maps them to corresponding ISL characters.
- **Real-time Translation**: Converts detected gestures into text.
- **Model Training**: Customizable training pipelines to improve recognition accuracy.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on various devices with camera support.
- **Open Source**: Freely available for further contributions and improvements.
